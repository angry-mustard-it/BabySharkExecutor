        <h1>Baby Shark assisting tool</h1>
        <p>Powered by Space Executor. This tool helps you to multi-aim and assist your targets by simply downloading and deep-diving into water in this cool executor.</p>
        <ul>Does it work?
            <li>Works in all games (PUBG, Standoff, Counterstrike, TF2) except for the ones who are Kernel mode and having a REALLY strong anticheat that sabotages, such as Fortnite (Which can get you REALLY banned for cheating and etc.)</li>
